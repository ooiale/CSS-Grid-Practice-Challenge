                    <p>Alright, enough talk, let's throw some good 'ol Lorem Ipsum to finish this article off.</p>
                    <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
                        the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
                        of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
                        but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
                        popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
                        Lorem Ipsum.</p>
                    <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
                    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                        when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                        distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                        readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
                        their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in
                        their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
                        purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
                    <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                        classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
                        Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin
                        words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                        classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32
                        and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                        written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                        Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
                        section 1.10.32.</p>
                    <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
                        Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced
                        in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
                        Rackham.</p>
                    <h3>Where can I get some?</h3>
                    <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
                        alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
                        believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
                        anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the
                        Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on
                        the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
                        sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum
                        is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>

                    <h2>Easter Egg</h2>
                    <p>
                        Carnifex Maximus Vardorvis is a dead vampyre whose corpse is found in the Stranglewood Ritual
                        Site. A high-ranking member of the Zarosian Empire, Vardorvis succumbed to the Strangler
                        parasite and has remained under its control ever since, where the player encounters it during
                        Desert Treasure II. A stronger variant of him can be fought again after the completion of the
                        quest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vardorvis was a vampyre who served the Zarosian Empire under the rank of Carnifex Maximus, whose
                        role was that of an executioner or headsman. He was one of four individuals entrusted with a
                        medallion - the means to open the Ancient Vault where the Elder Horn was sealed - alongside
                        Perseriya, Duke Sucellus, and the Whisperer, who were all high-ranking personnel in the Empire.

                        At some point during the Third Age, after the Betrayal of Zaros, he was deployed to Lassar to
                        defend the fortress from a siege by Saradominists. This included the Imcando dwarves, who
                        pledged their allegiance to Saradomin in exchange for a new settlement after their previous
                        home, Imcandoria, was destroyed. Once the Zarosian forces were driven out, the Imcando
                        dwarves set to build their new city, naming it Camdozaal.

                        During the siege, Yonrith Lovakengj, the opposing army leader, fled westward with his closest
                        allies and settled in modern-day Lovakengj, which Yonrith founded. However, believed to be
                        wounded by pride (as Yonrith was the first to escape him), Vardorvis brought a small force to
                        pursue him all the way to the western continent, and made camp in what is now known as the
                        Stranglewood.

                        On the sixth day of their pursuit, Vardorvis' venators successfully located the Imcando
                        dwarves. However, one of Vardorvis' subordinates, interested in studying the Strangler,
                        accidentally infected him with a sample of the parasite on the same day. As a result,
                        Vardorvis lost his vampyric immunity and was beheaded by the Imcando dwarves, who attacked
                        their camp the next day. Despite having "died", the plague reanimated his remains and moved
                        everything to the ritual site, where he would remain for thousands of years.

                        During the Fifth Age, an adventurer who sought his medallion eventually found and apparently
                        killed Vardorvis, who had remained under the Strangler's control, though it reanimated Vardorvis
                        again shortly after their departure.
